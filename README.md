#About the project

Thyroid nodules are dangerous if not diagnosed with precision. Thyroid nodules are commonly diagnosed and categorized based on their malignant potential, with previous studies primarily focused on binary classification as either benign or malignant. In this study, we address the limitations of the existing classification methods by proposing a highly efficient deep learning-based approach that expands the classification to six distinct classes with excellent precision. Our proposed method utilizes EfficientNet-B1 as the base model, known for its powerful feature extraction capabilities. 

We further enhance the model's performance by incorporating regularization techniques, such as dropout, to mitigate overfitting. The evaluation of our model on isolated data showcases exceptional performance, with 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. These outstanding scores highlight the model's remarkable ability to accurately classify thyroid tumors across multiple classes. We compare our model's performance with a reference model that includes a dropout rate of 60%, yielding almost the same results that validate the consistency of the proposed model for the distinct classification of thyroid nodules. By expanding the classification beyond binary outcomes, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of the malignant potential of thyroid nodules. Our study demonstrates the superiority of the proposed deep learning-based classification method for thyroid nodules by overcoming dataset limitations and imbalances. Our model exhibits improved performance compared to existing approaches. The outstanding accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity achieved underscore its potential as a reliable tool for clinicians in the diagnosis and classification of thyroid tumors.
